    <h3>Code Jams</h3>
    <p>
        I host weekly code jams - friends with a common desire to work on programming projects come to my apartment. This is a great way to learn new technologies and motivate yourself to complete side projects, which we are all guilty of sometimes putting to the side. If you're interested and live in the Raleigh area, shoot an email to me at <a href="mailto:jadekler@gmail.com">jadekler@gmail.com</a>.

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
        I love adventure! Whether that is travelling to new countries, or hiking in the Appalachian mountains, sky diving or bungie jumping, snowboarding or white water rafting - I'm up for it! I particularly enjoy spending time in nature, so whenever I can I try to find things to do outdoors: hiking, camping, and kayaking are my staple weekend adventure.

        As much as I enjoy spending time outside adventuring, I must admit that I'm also a huge book nerd. I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21107993-jean-de-klerk">love to read</a>! I'm also a pretty big PC games nerd (thanks dad), and an <i>avid</i> board gamer.

    <h3>Personal Life</h3>
    <p>
        Originally born and raised in South Africa, I moved at the age of 8 to England and later Sweden where I lived until I was 13. Following that, I spent another year in South Africa, after which I moved to Raleigh, NC USA. I spent four years at Leesville Road High School, where I graduated with Honors, and another four years at North Carolina State University. At NCSU, I studied Computer Science as my major and Theoretical Math as my minor: I Cum Laude graduated from both studies in 2013.
